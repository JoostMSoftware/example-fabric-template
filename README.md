# Example Template

This is a template for people from forge to get into Fabric. 

# What does it offer?

- [Forge Config api port](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-config-api-port-fabric/): Basically forge's config system.
- [Mod menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu/): Runs mod menu on startup
- Mojang mappings with parchment
- Quiltflower, It's a good decompiler!

# Useful tips

Please check the [Fabric Docs](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/start) if you need help with it! It's mainly writen with yarn mappings, but it should be easy to follow along!
